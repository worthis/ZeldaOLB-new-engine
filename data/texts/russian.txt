After Ganon's defeat and Triforce's disappearing, the legend lets us believe that peace has lasted...          But beneath each legend, a darker reality is often hidden...
The legend forgets that after these events, the hero was brought down by a terrible curse...
Day by day, Link was transforming into an incontrollable and destructive powered monster named Oni-Link...
Banished from Hyrule, Link asked for advice from Princess Zelda.
She indicated to him his last hope : a portal to a secret world...
Yes... It's this way...                         We are very near...
I'm sorry you can't have weapons with you...    But you see... You might transform yourself     whenever...                                     It's too dangerous...
Here we are! That's it!                         Don't move anymore, I set the portal...                                                         Are you ready?

If you are looking for a bomb bag, you should go to see the man working in the mine, he uses a lot of bombs.
There is a secret passage to the west of the    village which leads to Ordona Temple, but you   will need bombs to take it.
The mayor strictly forbade the access to the    mine because monsters go out.
You are saying that maybe someone is locked in  the mine? So what?
The mayor allowed you to pass? So move along!

Welcome to the Ruto village.                                                                    And just between us, don't trust anyone here...
Even if this village seems to be wealthy at     first sight, it's actually the poorest in       Termina... And we cannot rely on the mayor to   change that...
Tourists who come here used to be either lost,  or totally mad.                                                                                 For my part, I always have a map with me.

Destiny Tower                                   Hero of Hyrule watch out, vile Ganon now sits   here enthroned, the future of the world will be at stake here.

You must not transform yourself here!!!
You cannot go in this village with this appearance !!!
Link, it's Pit. I am talking with you by        telepathy. You must under no circumstances      transform yourself in a village!                I will teleport you outside.

You defeated the monster of the mine???         Congratulations!!!
I am the chief of the workers, you say you were looking for me?
Take this bag full of bomb, it may help you.
You find the Bomb Bag!!!                        And it's full!!!                                Press [INVENTAIRE] to set them up, and [OBJECT] to use them.
You came to save me?                            Thank you very much!
Digging in these galleries we discovered this   hang-out of monsters...
We all have been captured by the monsters living in these caverns.
Our chief is on the floor downstairs, go quickly to save him!
I found that in the mine, take it, it could help you!
I am the right hand man of the mayor, he sent me to save his daughter...                         But I've been had, there is nothing to do against these ghosts...
Don't stay here, you can't do anything with your actual weapons...
To continue your quest, follow the road at the west of the City. This bow will allow you to reach the sphere and open the way...
You defeated the vampire and came to save me?   Thank you so much! My father is the mayor of the City, go and see him, I'm sure he will reward you.
Don't worry about me, I can go back home by     myself now that the vampire is dead.

Hihihihihi!!!                                   Congratulation Link! You succeeded in getting   rid of your curse. And in the same way you      released me!!!
In reward for your efforts I won't kill you     today, I have a more important mission.
If you really want to stop me, meet me in the   dead temple if you are brave enough.            Farewell! Hihihihihi!!!
Link, it's Zelda, I am talking with you by      telepathy. I am with Pit, rejoin us quickly, the situation is serious.
I was waiting for you Link.                     I hand the power of the Goddness over to your   sword to restore the strenght of the Master     Sword.
Link, it's Zelda, I am talking to you by        telepathy. Do not go in this dungeon if you are not perfectly prepared, it's probably a trap by Oni-Link.
So you've come?                                 You probably want to die, it will be a pleasure to grant your wish.                             Hihihihihi!!!
The substance of Oni-Link have been locked in   the Spirit Mask!!!                              You succeed!!!
Grrrr!!! I can't believe you defeated           Oni-Link??? Impressive...                       I suppose you didn't expect to see me, though we are in the dead world.
Oni-Link gave me the energy I needed to         rematerialize, so I am back earlier than I      expected.                                       Gwahahahahaha !!!
By the way, maybe you wonder where Oni-Link is  from?                                           It's very easy, last time I wanted to be sure   you would never disturb me again, so I used the
Triforce to change you into a monster in my     legion. But there was not enough darkness in    your heart, so this transformation was not      dazzling...
Enough said, I have a lot of plans...           It would be a great pleasure to eliminate you,  but I don't think it would be useful...
For your information, only creatures of the dark can get out of here.                            So farewell! Gwahahahahaha !!!
Onily? So where is my coffee???                 What??? It's you Link???
                   Dead World
Link, it's Zelda, I am talking to you by        telepathy. It's terrible, Ganon is back!!!
He has recreated his army, which is getting     ready to attack Rauru!                          You still can stop them, go quickly to the West Field and intercept this army!
Grrrr... But how could you escape from the world of the deads and arrive here???
Why do you persist to challenge me?             Even if you strike me down I will always return to life.
Your quest is vain, abandon all hope!                                                           Let's rock, baby!
You find the Triforce !!!
Got rid of Ganon's curse, Link could return in    Hyrule safely.                                                                                      The Triforce, the Master Sword, and the Ocarina were handed over to the Royal Family of Hyrule, while Oni-Link Mask was entrusted to the Fairies to be hidden over space and time...                                                                     The portal leading to Termina was sealed by Princess Zelda and by Pit, so that it could never be opened again, and this terrible chapter was erased from the legend...
People of Hyrule never knew what happened in the  mysterious land of Termina, neither did they know that formidable Ganon was already preparing his   return...                                         But what everybody knew, was the return in Hyrule of its hero, who will always be there to protect  the Realm against the darkness.

Congratulations Link, for finding me.           I will raise the busload of your magic container to reward you.

You make me lose my time, off you go!
You don't have enough rupees!!!                 You make me lose my time, off you go!
I raise the maximum amount of bombs you can     carry on, thanks to who???
I raise the maximum amount of arrows you can    carry on, thanks to who???
I have enough rupees, disappear!
I let go through only maleficious creatures.
I let go through only beneficent creatures.
You look maleficious...                         Ok you can go!
You look beneficent...                          Ok you can go!
Link! It's Pit!!!                               What are you doing???                           Get a move on to the West Field!!!
You must wonder where you are.                  This is Termina, and you don't need to know more than that...
It's a secret land which should remain secret,  Princess Zelda should have never sent you       here...
More precisely you are in the Termina Forest. In this forest there is a temple, and in this temple there is a sacred object able to conjure any evil spell...
Find this object, and come back to see me.      I will open the portal again for your departure.
A last thing, do not go out of the forest under no circumstances! Your presence here is secret, and besides, in your state you are a threat for all people you come cross...
Good Luck Link!
What ??? The graal didn't succeed in getting rid of the curse???                                 That's... unthinkable...
This curse must be frightfully powerful... But  on closer examination, all hope is not lost...
The graal had an effect on you, you probably    noticed it. From now on you take more time to   transform yourself.
But it's double-edged... When you are transformed, you stay that way for a longer time...
Listen to me carefully Link, there are again 4  other graals in the temples of Termina...       It is said that the 5 combined have as much     power as the Triforce itself.
Thanks to the graal you found, you are a bit    less dangerous, so I authorize you to explore   Termina freely.
Venture out of this forest, search and find     these graals, and you will be saved.            But you must not go in a village if you are     transformed.
Take this map with you, it will probably be     useful...                                       Good Luck!
You find the Termina map!!!                                                                     Press [CARTE] when you are outside to see it.
I'm happy to see you safe and sound!            Now that you don't risk being transformed       anymore, I thought you would appreciate to have this...
Unfortunately you will need it...               Oni-Link has been liberated...                  We could have seen it before...
Each time you found a new graal, the frequency  of your transformations dampenned, but the      lenght of Oni-Link's life has risen...
Besides, Oni-Link's behavior is strange...      With his destructive temperament he should have attacked a village...
I should wallow, but I'm afraid that he has more important projects which is absolutely not good news...
However, we have drawn up a plan to vanquish him. Listen to me carefully...
The Master Sword is a formidable weapon, but it won't be useful to face Oni-Link...             ...for the moment...
There are 3 secret temples hidden in Termina. In these temples are fairies whose powers will raise the strenght of your sword. Find them all!
Then you will be on equal footing with Oni-Link. However, Oni-Link is only energy so he can't be killed...
The Spirit Mask will allow you to lock him inside forever. To do this, you will have to find this mask, find the magical Ocarina and find the melody which may lock him...
Your quest is just beginning...
Find the 3 fairies, the mask, the Ocarina, and  the song of spirit, and then go to face         Oni-Link!
As you know, the Master Sword can defeat ghosts, reflect magical attacks back, and destroy       magical fences...                               Put it to good use...
You succeed !                                   Hurry and confront Oni-Link at the Temple of    Xanto!
Oni-Link is waiting for you at the Temple of    Xanto, in the graveyard just west of Termina.
There is not time to loose!                     Go immediately to the West Field to intercept   Ganon's army!
Hurry up Link, what are you waiting for?        Christmas ???
Er... What about me ?                           I... er... ...protect the princess, that's it!  Who do you think has kept her from being kidnapped this time ? Huh ?
Link... there is a thing I should have told you since the beginning...                          This world, Termina...
This world is very new, it's a creation of the  Triforce through a wish...                      People, their memories and their stories have also been created...
Yes... as you guessed, it's me who asked the    Triforce to create this world... It's a world   built to contain all we might need.
You found there the graals, Oni-Link found his  master, and Ganon found...                      ...the Triforce...
I created this world to be used as a hideaway   for the Triforce, but Ganon found it...
Link! This land and these people have been      created, but they are truly real now! If we     don't do anything, this land will soon look like the ancient Dark World!
I leave it to you again, Link, save this world!
Welcome to the study house of all kind of       monsters!
You probably remember me, you helped me a lot in Hyrule.                                         Uh... You wonder how I came in Termina? Uh... doesn't matter!
This vast world has an abundance of monsters, so I had to be on the trip!
I will list all monsters in a new encyclopedia!                                                                                                 With your help, of course.
Unfortunately I don't have pieces of heart      anymore, but currency is my new currency.       I will pay you a good price for each new monster added in the encyclopedia.
Come here regularly to get your winnings. If you can't carry all, I will keep the surplus for your next visit.
You just have to beat a new enemy to add him in the encyclopedia.                               You can see it by pressing [MONSTERS]!
Mmm... you are a curious specimen...            I will add you in the encyclopedia!!!
Mmm... you are a curious specimen...
I owe you [v=1] rupees.
Do you want to be paid now?                                                                                   [c=2]YES[c=0]              NO

I have a scoop for you, monsters you defeated in Hyrule have been mysteriously brought to the life! They are supposed to wander in Termina...
They are said to be three.                      If you beat them all, I will give you a...      special prize...
You defeated the 3 rare monsters???             ...                                             You reward is waiting for you downstairs...
You defeated all monsters...                    It's incredible...
Hello Link, how are your bombs?
I don't have anymore prizes to bring into play, sorry.
One of these chests contains a piece of heart,  do you want to try for 10 rupees?               You will be allowed to open just one chest, ok?                [c=2]YES[c=0]              NO

What would you like to drink?
You are looking for the man who works in the    mine? Nobody has seen him since they locked the mine... Maybe he is trapped inside...
This saloon was very popular...                 ...before...
I AM the mayor of this village, and I do NOT    want to talk with you!
You say that someone is perhaps locked in the   mine?                                                                                           ... ... ...
Very well, give me 10 rupees and I will allow   you to go into the mine. Ok?                                  [c=2]YES[c=0]              NO

You need a bomb bag to buy this.
Come back when you have an empty bottle and I will sell you some potions.
Red potions restore energy and green potions restore magic.

He-He-He!
Hello! I know everything about all what is said in the city, come to see me if you need         information.
You want to know why the mayor is so silent?    Okay, but I didn't say anything, huh?
This city has a terrible secret...              During the night, young girls are captured, we  never see them again... I don't dare even to go out...
Last night, according to the rumours, the       mayor's daughter would have disapeared...
Hello! Mister-who-fears-the-hens,               He! He! He!
You are said to have climbed the Flatty         Mountain? Congratulations! He! He! He!
You... you know about my daughter?              It's terrible... My dear daughter...
According to the inquiry I conducted since the  beginning of these events, the captured young   girls seem to be brought into the mansion at the north village...
I already sent the guards there, but no one came back...
So this morning, when I discovered my own       daughter was not here anymore, I beg my hired   hand to bring her back... He is a perfect       combatant, but he is abnormally slow...
You look to be a combatant too, do you want to  see what happened there?                        You will have a great reward if you rescue my daughter.
Go to see the guard at the north-west of the    city, he will let you pass.
Save my daughter at the mansion, You will be    greatly rewarded!
My daughter told me everything, I owe you so    much!!!
Listen carefully, I will teach you a song, it   is an heirloom handed down from generation to   generation:                                     The Elegy of Emptiness!
You learn the Elegy of Emptiness!!!                                                             Use the Ocarina to play it!
You learn the Elegy of Emptiness!!!                                                             You need a musical instrument to play it!
The Elegy of Emptiness has mysterious powers... ...I think.
Hello mister-my-rescuer!
One blue potion for 160 rupees?                 You won't be deceived...                                      [c=2]YES[c=0]              NO

Good morning, we can't see such a powerful      monster every day, it's a honour...
You should go to play in the Colosseum at the   south-east village, there is an interesting     prize to win...
You won the prize of the Colosseum?             Impressive...
If you think you are the most terrifying monster of Termina, that mean you believe your dreams are reality my poor friend...
Take my word, the monster of the lake is by far the most terrifying of all monsters. Most of all avoid fighting him, that's my advice.
The colosseum south of here is the principal    entertainment of the village.                   The goal is to go as far as possible before     being killed.
But it's always very difficult to find          volunteers, so the chief was obligated to put a very hight valued object inside.
Do you want to listen to my story for 10 rupees?                                                              [c=2]YES[c=0]              NO

According to the chief, north of here there is  the Xanto temple, also known as the dead        temple...
This temple is said to be a way from the world  of living to the world of the deads... But to   reach the world of the deads, you would have to go trough an impassable labyrinth...
Pay me again if you want me to repeat.
You are looking for the Spirit Mask?            ... Fancy that...
No, I don't know where it is, but I know how to use it.                                         Come back if you find it and I will help you.
You find the Spirit Mask???                     ...                                             Okay, listen carefully, I will teach you how to use it.
In the presence of a weakened spirit, you will  have to play the Song of Spirit with your       ocarina.                                        Listen the Song of Spirit!
You learn the Song of Spirit!!!                                                                 Use the Ocarina to play it!
The Spirit Mask can be used only one time, put  it to good use...
You locked a terribly powerful spirit...        Make sure that he never falls into bad hands...
Our village rarely receives visitors...         It's maybe related to the fact we blocked the   entry...
You are the only visitor I have seen since I    live here...                                    I am an ancient adventurer, I was very talented as a treasure hunter...
One day I heard the story of the pyramid's      treasure, a magical object...                   But this desert caused my ruin, I could never   cross over it. It is really too dangerous...
You look as determined as I was in my youth...
That's a deal, if you bring me the pyramid's    treasure, I will give you my most precious      treasure.
You found the treasure???                       A fire rod, huh?                                ...                                             ...
This rod will help you more than me...          You can keep it...
Accept this reward to show an old man the       treasure he searched for all his life...        The Song of Soaring!!!
Played with a magical instrument, this song will teleport you. I had hoped I could cross over the desert with this, but I never found the good instrument...
You learn the Song of Soaring!!!                                                                Use the Ocarina to play it!
Tutorial : when the gauge of anger is full, you are transformed into Oni-Link.                  Your weapon is extended and your strenght       increases while your defense reduces.
As Oni-Link, you cannot use objects, but you can teleport yourself to the entry when you are in a dungeon by pressing [TELEPORT].
Each time Oni-Link defeats an enemy, your gauge decreases. When it's empty, Link regain his normal form.
It does not work...
